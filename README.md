# Vuetify Project Setup and Data Visualization
~ This project is centered around a dynamic and interactive data table built using Vue.js and the Vuetify UI library. It involves visualizing and manipulating data provided in a JSON file. Key features of the table include search functionality, the ability to filter and sort columns,. Additionally, clicking on a table row opens a detailed view of that record, either in a new page or a modal window. The project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for efficient data analysis and management, leveraging the capabilities of Vue.js, Vuetify, and advanced front-end technologies.
